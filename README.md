WolfreeAlpha
============

A php-script which used to generate WolframAlpha pro-accounts for free. 
Made public after WolframAlpha decided to patch this.
THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE.

The script runs for about 20 seconds, continously sending status updates to the client. 

The script created a basic account with credible names and email, then starting a free trial of the pro version and verifying it by clicking a link WolframAlpha sent to a fake email-account to prove its legitimacy.
